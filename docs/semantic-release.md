# Semantic Release: Automating the Release Workflow

Semantic Release is an open-source tool that we're using in this project to
automate our software release process. It provides several benefits that make
our development process more efficient and reliable.

## Why Use Semantic Release?

### Automated Versioning

Semantic Release uses the commit messages to determine the type of changes in
the codebase. It follows the Semantic Versioning (semver) specification and
automatically updates the version number based on the type of changes.

### Automated Release Notes

Semantic Release generates release notes based on the commit messages. This
ensures that our release notes are always up-to-date and accurately reflect the
changes in each release.

### Continuous Delivery

With Semantic Release, every merge to the main branch can potentially be a new
release. This aligns with the Continuous Delivery philosophy and ensures that
our software is always in a releasable state.

### Time Saving

Semantic Release automates tasks that are often done manually, like updating
the version number and writing release notes. This saves us time and reduces
the risk of human error.

## How Does Semantic Release Work?

Semantic Release works in stages:

1. **Verify Conditions**: Checks the release environment to ensure it's
2. configured correctly.
3. **Analyze Commits**: Determines the type of changes in the codebase by
4. analyzing the commit messages.
5. **Verify Release**: Determines the version of the next release based on the
6. results of the commit analysis.
7. **Generate Notes**: Generates release notes for the new release.
8. **Prepare**: Updates the package.json and other files with the new version
9. number.
10. **Publish**: Publishes the new release to npm (or another package manager).
11. **Notify**: Sends notifications about the new release.

In this project, we're using Semantic Release to automate our release workflow.
It's a powerful tool that helps us maintain a consistent release process and
ensures that our software is always in a releasable state.

Remember, Semantic Release is not just a tool, it's a methodology that
encourages a more structured and disciplined approach to software releases.
It's a valuable addition to our project and well worth the time invested in
setting it up and using it.
